# How many resolved incidents the `incidents` table itself keeps (see the
# retention DELETE in record_alert_event below) — and therefore the natural
# ceiling for get_history()'s own limit. It used to default to and be called
# with json_store.MAX_HISTORY (1000): fine for that JSON fallback file, whose
# every write is a full-list rewrite on the hot alert path and stays cheap
# only because it's small, but wrong to reuse here — this table is indexed
# (idx_incidents_updated_at) and a read of it costs low-single-digit ms even
# near this cap, so capping the PRIMARY, fast, source-of-truth read path to
# the JSON fallback's much smaller number silently dropped real incidents
# from a 35+ day History view (at this fleet's incident-volume, ~1000
# resolved incidents accumulates in well under 35 days) while 4000 more sat
# right there in the table, already paid for.

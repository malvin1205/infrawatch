Fleet availability & SLA calculator.

Menghitung metrik ketersediaan, coverage, dan SLA terverifikasi secara matematis:
  1. per_server          — availability, uptime, downtime, coverage, unknown, dan SLA eligibility
  2. fleet_aggregate     — weighted availability berdasarkan total coverage waktu (metrik SLA enterprise)
  3. fleet_average       — rata-rata unweighted dari target dengan availability valid
  4. sla_compliance      — persentase target SLA-eligible yang memenuhi target >= 99.9%
  5. health_ratio        — persentase target valid yang zero downtime (100% up)
  6. coverage_ratio      — persentase observasi data aktual terhadap requested window
  7. analytics           — total insiden, mean, median (P50), P95, dan max outage duration


BUCKET & MERGE INVARIANTS (the contract every path here must preserve)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
An `availability_buckets` row, and every dict returned by clip_hourly_bucket()
/ merge_hybrid_target_availability(), holds ACTUAL OBSERVED SECONDS — never a
nominal or projected figure. For a completed hour the observed interval is the
whole [bucket_start, bucket_end]; for the in-progress hour it is only
[bucket_start, now]. A bucket is stored with a nominal hour end for schema
convenience, so consumers must clip the *time interval* to `now` and must NOT
re-scale the already-observed seconds a second time (see clip_hourly_bucket).

For any bucket / clipped result / per-target entry over an effective interval
of `dur` seconds ending no later than `now`:

  I1  uptime_seconds + downtime_seconds == coverage_seconds        (± 0.05)
  I2  coverage_seconds <= dur                                      (± 0.05)
  I3  coverage_seconds <= elapsed  (bucket_end is clipped to now;  no future
                                    time is ever observed or "unknown")
  I4  unknown_seconds == dur - coverage_seconds                    (>= 0)
  I5  availability_pct is None  iff  coverage_seconds == 0 ;
      otherwise 0 <= availability_pct <= 100  and  == uptime/coverage*100
  I6  coverage_percent + unknown_percent == 100                    (± 0.05)

availability_pct (= uptime/coverage) and coverage_percent (= coverage/
requested_window) use DIFFERENT denominators on purpose: the first is the SLA
number, the second is how much of the window we actually observed. Unmonitored
time is excluded from the SLA denominator, never counted as downtime.

reconstruct_time_series_intervals() enforces the same I1-I6 from raw samples
(its own "Mathematical Invariants Enforced" list) and is the exact reference
for what the bucket path approximates.

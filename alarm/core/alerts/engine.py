"""Alerts / incidents domain: the firing/resolved state machine, maintenance-
window suppression, and dependency (alert-correlation) links.

record_alert_event() is the single funnel both the Alertmanager webhook and

incidents table and the status/logs/history JSON caches, deduping repeat
notifications, and fires the async Telegram dispatch. Maintenance windows are

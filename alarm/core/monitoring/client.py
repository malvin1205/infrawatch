"""Prometheus HTTP access layer for InfraWatch.

Everything that speaks the Prometheus HTTP API and the machinery around it:
the registered-endpoint state cache, the per-PromQL response cache, single-
flight coalescing locks, the failed-candidate circuit breaker, the shared
worker pool, the DNS-rebinding hot-path re-check, and endpoint failover in
`fetch_prometheus_json`.

Extracted verbatim from app.py — behaviour is unchanged. app.py re-imports
every public name from here (including the caches/locks the tests reach into)
so `import app as alarm_app; alarm_app.PROMETHEUS_CACHE` keeps working. The
thin per-shape adapters that parse a Prometheus response into an
`{instance: value}` map (`fetch_prom_query_map` etc.) stay in app.py next to
their callers.

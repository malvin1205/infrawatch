"""Shared constants for InfraWatch.

Deployment-tunable knobs and fixed identifiers used across the request
handlers, the monitoring-state engine, the availability pipeline, and the
background workers. Kept in one leaf module (no InfraWatch imports) so the
domain modules extracted from app.py can share them without importing app.

app.py re-imports every name, so `import app as alarm_app; alarm_app.DEFAULT_JOB_FILTER`
is unchanged.
